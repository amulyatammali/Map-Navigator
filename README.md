# Map-Navigator
This repository contains my mini project titled 'map Navigator'.
#  Project Objective:
The main objective of the project is to facilitate safe and efficient navigation by 
providing users with the shortest path between two locations on a map while 
ensuring awareness of potential hazards along the way. By integrating hazard 
detection and alert mechanisms into the shortest path finding process, users can 
make informed decisions during their journey.
# overview :
This project provides an interactive map-based application to find and visualize the shortest path between two locations. The application utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to navigate through the path, considering possible hazards. The map is built using the Leaflet library, providing a user-friendly interface with OpenStreetMap tiles.
## key features:

  <body>
    <ol>
      <li><h5>Interactive Map Interface:</h5><p>Users can view a map with markers for different cities.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Shortest Path Calculation:</h5><p>Input starting and destination locations to find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Path Visualization:</h5><p> The calculated shortest path is highlighted on the map, with different colors indicating hazards and normal routes.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Hazard Alerts:</h5><p>Alerts are displayed if any hazards are detected along the path, based on predefined data.</p></li>
      <li><h5>City-to-City Navigation: </h5><p> Simple interface to enter city names and visualize the route.</p></li>
    </ol>
     <h3>How to Run:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository.</li>
    <li>Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.</li>
    <li>Interact with the map and input fields to find and visualize the shortest path between cities.</li>
  </ol>
    <p>This project provides a foundational understanding of integrating algorithms with interactive maps and offers potential for further enhancements, such as real-time data integration and expanding the graph with more locations.</p>
    <p>Feel free to contribute by adding more features, improving the UI, or optimizing the algorithms. </p>
